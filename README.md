# Socket-Python

A Python socket is a low-level networking interface in the Python programming language that allows applications to communicate over a network. Sockets provide a way for processes to communicate with each other over a network, using a client/server model.
A socket is essentially a connection between two endpoints over a network, such as a connection between a client and a server. A socket provides a mechanism for sending and receiving data between these two endpoints.

The python socket collects the information from the human resources company client and transmits it to the server, then it sends it to a database depending on the request that has been previously made: update, create, delete or consult
